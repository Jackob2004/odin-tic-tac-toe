# Introduction
Tic-tac-toe game leveraging JavaScript IIFE modules.

It is a part of The Odin project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe

# Functionality
- displaying player stats associated with names
- starting a completely new game or playing a new round with the same players
- interacting with game gird
- displaying current turn
- displaying game over results

# Reflection 
Important topics learned/practiced:

- IIFE modules achieving encapsulation and namespacing
- factory functions
- closures
- separation of concerns

After designing core modules responsible for gameboard and game flow connecting them to UI
was just a matter of time. Basically a game could also function in the console.
